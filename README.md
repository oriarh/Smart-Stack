 ## Description
 The purpose of this project was to build an application that helps recent coding bootcamp graduates prepare for the technical interview. Coding bootcamp sessions move very quickly and itâ€™s easy to miss some simple concepts.  Smart Stack can also be used as a tool to review basic concepts that may have been missed during the bootcamp course. Smart Stack is an interactive and easy to use interface where the user can pick which topic they want to learn about and they will presented with popular interview questions for that topic. A big part of the motivation to build this application was not only to create a useful web application to help graduates prepare for the next step in landing a job, but to gain a better understanding of popular developer tools such as REACT, Express, node, and NoSql database like MongoDB.
